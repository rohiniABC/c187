                    Go On An Adventure: Code Your Own Game
Adventure games are one of the oldest genres of video game, so why not try your hand at creating one?

Of course this could be a traditional fantasy adventure with monsters, mages, and magic, but it could also be in a futuristic setting, or even an ordinary one. The adventure game aspect is more about the gameâ€™s mechanics: exploration, unlocking areas, and maybe some combat.

These allow for creativity while still pushing you to learn from existing tutorials for creating games in this genre.
